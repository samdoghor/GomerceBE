## Virtual environment

How to setup a python virtual environment

- Create the virtual environment,

<<<<<<< HEAD
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Gomerce/GomerceBE.git
$ cd GomerceBE
```
=======
  ```
  python -m venv .venv
  ```
>>>>>>> f777bf00731cae12835ada355360bf9ae8ca3067

- Activate the virtual environment
  - for windows
  ```
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
  - for Linux / macOS
  ```
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```
- Deactivate the virtual environment when you need to,

  ```
  deactivate
  ```

## Install requirements

For local development

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For production

```
pip install -r requirements-prod.txt
```

## Set environment variables

- Make a copy of the `example.env` file, and rename it to `.env`

- Update the values of the variables in the `.env` file to suite your system environment.

- Create a folder named `logs` in the root directory, if it does not exist

## Datebase setup

### Create databases

Create a Postgres database with the name matching what you have on the `.env` file for `DB_NAME` and `TEST_DB_NAME`. For example:

```
createdb gomerce
createdb gomerce-test
```

### Export your flask app

In order to run your migrations and app using the `flask` command, expose your flask app:

- for Linux / macOS

```
export FLASK_APP=src/server.py
```

- for windows
  - On CMD
  ```
  SET FLASK_APP=src/server.py
  ```
  - On BASH
  ```
  export FLASK_APP=src/server.py
  ```
  - On POWERSHELL
  ```
  $env:FLASK_APP=src/server.py
  ```

### **Create database tables from migrations**

To add the existing database schema and dummy data to your datebase, run:

```
flask db upgrade
```

Make your database changes accessible to others using migrations

```
flask db migrate
```

### **Run server application**

From the root folder, run

```
python src/server.py
```

The application will run at the specified port `APPLICATION_PORT` in `.env` file

The local URL to access the API should be `http://localhost:3303/`

You can visit the Products URL to test the application at `http://localhost:3303/products`
